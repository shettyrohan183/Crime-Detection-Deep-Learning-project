# Problem Statement
The state CCTV Control Room receives feeds from number of CCTV Cameras across the state. It is not possible to monitor all the camera feeds in live scenario. The solution Should be capable of reading the feeds being received from the cameras and analyses the feeds for any criminal activity

Detecting suspicious activities in public places has become an important task due to the increasing number of shootings, knife attacks, terrorist attacks, etc. happening in public places all around the world. This project focuses on a deep learning approach to detect suspicious activities using Convolutional Neural Networks from images and videos. 
Currently, surveillance cameras play a vital role to ensure the safety of the people, yet they are plain video-providing entities with no smart decision-making mechanisms of their own. Because of this growth of data composed from surveillance cameras, automated video streams have become a requisite for automatically detecting abnormal events
